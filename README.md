### Mining of social media to Inform COVID-19 Response in Uganda- Mugume Twinamatsiko Atwine

**Introduction:** The study aimed to explore the type of discussions, facts, sentiments, myths Ugandans shared about COVID-19, and identify top Twitter influencers on COVID-19 as well. Twitter was prefered because of the amounts of information that can be made available concerning different aspects of life. This is besides Twitter’s high volume of 320M active users & about 6M tweets daily.

**Methods:** Geotagged information to return-tweets from Uganda was mined between 1st March, 2020 – 30th October, 2020 using #COVID19UG, #COVID-UG, #COVID19_UG. Twitter data was divided into three sub categories, Before Lockdown, During and After lockdown. Data analysis focused on words and contexts generated by Twitter influencers who had been selected basing on Account age (how long the account has been active > 5yrs), Follow Ratio (the ratio of following/followers - 0.3),and Engagement Ratio (Relates total number of tweets versus public engagement – higher ratio = more engagement - 1.5). Selection biased Influencer tweets without location, in local languages or censored by Twitter based on association with COVID-19 myths. The study also excluded a population that discussed COVID-19 on non-Twitter social media platforms.

**Findings:** #COVID was the most used hashtag featuring over 350,000 times in April 2020 – the second month of lockdown. Hydroxyl chloroquine + eating garlic featured highest in tweet discussions concerning myths. COVID19-related sentiments gradually diminished between March and July 2020, peaking again in October 2020.

**Lessons:** Social media data mining has great potential to inform response towards COVID-19. Collecting and analyzing citizen’s sentiments has capacity to inform selection of most useful prevention measures for COVID19. Twitter subscribers who qualify to be influencers have a potential in mass sensitization on COVID-19 prevention measuresif equipped with the correct information
